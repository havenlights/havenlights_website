        Un ascolto che consigliamo a tutti i fan del power metal nordeuropeo, un piacevole viaggio in un mondo sospeso tra dolci melodie e virtuosismi veloci come le aeronavi che solcano i cieli dell’immaginazione, alla ricerca di un porto sicuro per attraccare.

    <h3>2. Reckless Angel</h3>
    <p class="author">Music & Lyrics by Francesco Bertolaccini</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      One single man's desire<br>
      An entire mankind's dream<br>
      To fly over the skies<br>
      Above the hills and seas<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      No matter what you think<br>
      No matter what you plan<br>
      You're gonna drown and sink<br>
      You're gonna burn like hell<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      And in the end,<br>
      What's this all about?<br>
      To escape from the world,<br>
      To be far from the crowd?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      No, it's too late<br>
      For this to happen<br>
      This mortal coil<br>
      It's a burden of men!<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      Fly away<br>
      Reckless angel<br>
      Icarus' fate<br>
      Mankind's dream<br>

      Fly away<br>
      Close your eyes<br>
      You're not that far<br>
      If you don't look down<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      And then one mortal day<br>
      You look back and see<br>
      What you've made of your life<br>
      What became of your deeds<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      All that you might have built<br>
      All that you might have planned<br>
      All that you thought was real<br>
      A step away from Sun<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      And now it's all gone<br>
      No phoenix from ashes<br>
      Sail back to your world<br>
      While your ship crashes!<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Father don't cry<br>
      You gave me the wings<br>
      I chose my own death<br>
      My desires are fulfilled<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Now I will rest<br>
      In the depth of the ocean<br>
      Now I fear no pain<br>

    <h3>3. Long Lost Rhyme</h3>
    <p class="author">Music & Lyrics by Alessandro Petri</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      I remember those darkest times<br>
      And those brightest dawns with you<br>
      The Memory of the two of us,<br>
      Fades away in the stormy night.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      How can this be over? Your memory lives on,<br>
      it won't fade away<br>
      The shadow of my rhymes will borrow your grace<br>
      A ship in the dark of the dying day<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      Don't you cry, don't deny,<br>
      Hold those moments stuck in time,<br>
      A moonlight sight and two souls were entwined,<br>
      Heed the cry of my long-lost rhyme<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The darkness shone down on me<br>
      Trapped inside the cage of reality<br>
      Drown, at the shipwreck of my life<br>
      Without you by my side<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The ocean beneath us,<br>
      The rise of the tide, you're slipping away<br>
      Our souls now divided, an eternal phrase<br>
      Lost in the dark of the dying day<br>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Till I'm Gone</h3>
    <p class="author">Music & Lyrics by Francesco Bertolaccini</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The wheel of life will turn<br>
      In the sky once again<br>
      Waiting for the time to come<br>
      Wandering souls<br>
      Searching for a path to walk<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The silver wheel still shines<br>
      Bright in the starlit nigth<br>
      Inspiring in our hearts new hope<br>
      Wandering souls<br>
      Searching for a way to go<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      Northern lights up in sky<br>
      We'll find peace tonight<br>
      Sunrise lies ahead<br>
      To the horizon we gaze<br>
      We'll get out of this maze<br>
      I will run like a fool<br>
      'Till I'm gone<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Rising is the dawn<br>
      Of a day that springs anew<br>
      A new chapter of our brittle lives<br>
      Wandering souls<br>
      Our lives will have a sense again<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Another chance to win<br>
      Another chance to lose<br>
      Another chance to live once more<br>
      Wandering souls<br>
      What matters is our will to live<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Don't try to understand this eternal wheel<br>
      It is neverending<br>
      All you can do is embrace it<br>
      And let its wind bring you far away<br>

    <h3>5. In My Dreams</h3>
    <p class="author">Music & Lyrics by Francesco Bertolaccini</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Alone in a corner of my lonely soul<br>
      Is it hope, or is it just illusion?<br>
      I wait in vain for a glimpse of your smile<br>
      I wait, I wait but never tell<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Once upon a time, I was happy and blind<br>
      Content of my life as a hermit<br>
      Once I was struck, made my world fall apart<br>
      Made me see what I've always left behind<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      How can I forget, how can I unsee<br>
      What I've learnt and what I've seen?<br>
      Can I turn back time, can I return blind<br>
      Will you always be in my dreams?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Will I stay in the shadows as I always do<br>
      Will I let my fear of failing keep me away from you<br>
    </p>

    <h3>6. Fade Away</h3>
    <p class="author">Music by Daniele Davalle &amp; Alessandro Petri<br>Lyrics by Daniele Davalle</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The dawn of a new day,<br>
      but it's always the same<br>
      Entrapped in a worn dream,<br>
      slowly torn to a nightmare<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      An empty soul, in an empty house,<br>
      once a home, once our life<br>
      Just another sunny day<br>
      with uncomfortable colours<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Where are you now?  You went away<br>
      Remember you said: "Never apart"<br>
      Now I walk with no more tears to cry<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      Fade away, just fade away<br>
      All the dreams we had one day<br>
      Fade away, they'll fade away<br>
      Under the pouring rain<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      A flower withered within,<br>
      giving in to the wind<br>
      The bittersweet memory<br>
      of its splendour in the sunlight<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The eyes were filled with joy and hope<br>
      Burning strong burning bright<br>
      A dizzying emptiness left<br>
      by the change of the season<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Where are you now?  You went away<br>
      Remember you said: "Never apart"<br>
      Now I walk with no more tears to cry<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Can you see the rain is falling?<br>
      Can you hear the tears are dripping?<br>
      Can you see the leaves are falling?<br>
      Can you feel the heart is bleeding?<br>

    <h3>7. Sands of Time</h3>
    <p class="author">Music &amp; Lyrics by Francesco Bertolaccini</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Destiny's still moving faster<br>
      Directs you where to go<br>
      Where are you gonna end up stranded?<br>
      You don't know<br>
      You feel you need to take a break<br>
      To recap what you've done<br>
      But time won't engage reverse gear<br>
      You've been warned<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Seven hundred seven days<br>
      Or more, you can't recall<br>
      Have been washed away in vain<br>
      They are forlorn<br>
      It's sad they'll haunt you until the end<br>
      They're gone forevermore<br>
      There is no way to take 'em back<br>
      They are no more<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Time's running out and you're wondering<br>
      Who will save you<br>
      "Who will save me?<br>
      My hair's growing gray<br>
      People fading away<br>
      With time"<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      Sands of time flowing<br>
      The hourglass is filling<br>
      The clocks have been ticking<br>
      For way too long<br>
      Tell me my friend<br>
      Is there a way to amend<br>
      All the sins I have made<br>
      Before it's too late?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Once I was standing tall on the tower of life<br>
      Wind in my hair, sun on my face<br>
      Now all I see is the past behind me<br>
      Wasted time taunts me until the end of my days<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Maybe my time here is up now, I'm done<br>
      They said time it catches up with you at last<br>
      Everything we do, everything we have<br>
      Is it really just for time to be turned into ash?<br>

    <h3>8. Havenlights</h3>
    <p class="author">Music &amp; Lyrics by Francesco Bertolaccini</p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      <em>[Act 1: Departure]</em><br>
      Say your goodbyes<br>
      We're leaving tonight<br>
      Last chance to see<br>
      The golden sunrise<br>
      All board the starship<br>
      Hatches go down<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Sails are set<br>
      Engines are running<br>
      We're sailing away<br>
      To new horizons, new skies<br>
      Now sit down, hang on tight<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      <em>[Act 2: The voyage]</em><br>
      The vastness of space we've just left behind<br>
      A coldness you feel deep inside<br>
      Wandering through black voids and bright starlit nights<br>
      I promise, one day we'll be there<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Across barren lands, desert's all's in sight<br>
      I will keep on searching, desperate measures for desperate times<br>
      I just know, I feel, it's out there somewhere<br>
      And it's waiting for us to be found<br>
      A port in the stars, I'll step on new ground<br>
      We will make our dreams true right there<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      Through the stars we ride<br>
      Hundred thousand miles to find<br>
      A haven, a light<br>
      Our home in the sky, together<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics chorus">
      I will find the way<br>
      Never lose your hope, your faith<br>
      Destination is near, there's no reason to fear<br>
      We'll live to see the haven lights<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Six months have passed but the end is still far<br>
      We still haven’t found our star<br>
      How long will it be until our voyage is over?<br>
      How long till we’re back on dry land?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Brace yourselves, my friends: a storm is getting near<br>
      We need all hands on deck, this is not the time for fear<br>
      The hull’s been breached, we’re shutting the bulkheads<br>
      Prepare for the coming impact<br>
      But hope’s not lost, we’ll make it again<br>
      The voyage will not end today<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      <em>[Act 3: Sacrifice]</em><br>
      The path is long and risky<br>
      Brave people lost to the eternal skies<br>
      Forever<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Ride on<br>
      Far away<br>
      There's no time for looking back<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Ride on<br>
      Don't lose your way<br>
      There's no way to bring em back<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      We always knew it would not<br>
      Be an easy, quick or painless ride<br>
      And they knew it too<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      <em>[Act 4: Remembrance]</em><br>
      Now we've come so far<br>
      We've lost, and we've gained so much<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The road was long and windy<br>
      It is worth it, I used to say<br>
      The hope was bright and it was blinding<br>
      I never questioned it, anyway<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Remember: seize the day<br>
      Don't let the memories fade away<br>
      We've travelled so fast and so far<br>
      Deep wounds will always leave a scar<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      Far away<br>
      Deep in the stars<br>
    </p>
    <p class="lyrics">
      The souls we've left behind<br>
      Watch over the ones we're still to find<br>
      The ones who sacrificed themselves<br>
      Helped us: we've made it in the end<br>

      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        The Havenlights project came into being when two separate paths crossed, as a result of the encounter between a duo and a lone, young guitarist.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2016, after leaving his first band, Francesco was asked by a local emergent band to join as a guitarist. While the project did not come to fruition and never left the rehearsal stage, Francesco had the chance to meet Alessandro, who was to join the band as a keyboard player, and found that they shared an interest for the same kind of music. <br>
        After this project came to an end, Francesco and Alessandro went on working together and improving some of the tracks that Francesco had written.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in 2000, Daniele and Alessandro met as high school classmates and started playing together in several metal and rock bands, mainly cover bands, writing sporadically some songs that never got recorded nor completed. One among these cover bands, was a Nightwish tribute band.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019 they felt that it was time to get together recording and playing the songs that had been written for their previous projects but never published. <br>
        However, Francesco, Daniele and Alessandro were still missing a key component: a great vocalist for their songs. They asked Linda, who had previously sung with Daniele and Alessandro in their Nightwish tribute band, to join them in the recordings. <br>
        In the end, the project grew more ambitious and the idea of recording new songs for a complete full length came about. And here we are, <em>hang on tight and enjoy the flight.</em>

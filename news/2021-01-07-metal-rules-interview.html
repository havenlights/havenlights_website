    Havenlights is one of those bands that has proven to be above the circumstances. After a year of recording remotely and separately, they have finally finished their debut album: Songs of Autumn, a totally independent work that will be released in February and shows once again the enormous talent that exists in the underground scene. Francesco Bertolaccini and Alessandro Petri tell us about an album that every fan of power metal should not ignore.
